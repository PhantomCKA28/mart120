        <span>This is my short story</span>

            'Yes, it finally arrived' I thought out loud to no one but myself. My telescope that I had ordered several months ago is now in my living room.
            Grabbing my trusted box cutter and peeling away all the unnecessary packaging. Hours later, two glasses of wine down, and its finally put
            together just in time to look at the stars. Parking it right in front of my upstairs window, adjusting the angle I get ready to look through my
            telescope. Thinking I am going to see stars, all I see is...
